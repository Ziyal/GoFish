# Go Fish

Go Fish is a mini-hackathon/group project completed in approx. 5 hours. The game creates a deck of cards, a player, and CPU player objects on page load. jQuery was used to display visuals (card images, score, and what last happened, e.g. “CPU asked for 6 of Diamonds and went Go Fish”) and allow the player to interact with the game. The game ends when one of the players runs out of cards.

Collaboration with: Bill Peterson and Michele Zeller
